# network-security
Projects developed during Network Security course at Northeastern University in Fall 2015
<br />
1.  LocalExploits<br />
2.  ManInTheMiddleAttacks<br/>
3.  Network_Intrusin_Detection<br/>
•  Extensively used Snort for Network Intrusion Detection to detect attacks through the network. <br/>
•  Extensively used AIDE (a Host based Intrusion Detection tool) to detect intrusions by monitoring the filesystem and alerting the users  on occurance of any suspicious changes.<br/>
4.  Password_cracking<br />
5.  Vulnerability_Scanning<br/>
6.  BufferOverFlow<br/>
7.  client-server chat application<br />
8.  cryptography-app<br />
9.  finger_printing<br/>
10. port_scanning<br/>
11. stealth_scanning<br/>
12. Application Exploits<br/>
   •  Exploited a sandboxed web application(Gruyere and another custom web app) for Vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting(XSS) cross-site request forgery(XSRF)/Path traversal and analysed methods to find/avoid such vulnerabilities.<br/>
• Analyzed SQL Injection exploit by injecting arbitory SQL queries to the Database.<br/>

13. Arxivpaper.pdf : Paper published on the topic "Critical Survey of Privacy Infrastructures"<br />
14. HostHardening<br/> 
•  Hardened the machines to make it more secure against any risks and threats by thorough analysis of the current system processes and disabling processes which tend to provide a lot of useful information to the attackers and by shutting down unnecessary TCP/IP services running on the system.
